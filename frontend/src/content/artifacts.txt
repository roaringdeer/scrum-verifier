<p>There are three Scrum Arctifacts: Product Backlog, Sprint Backlog and Increment. Each one represents some work or value, and are
created with transparency in mind, so that everyone in the Scrum Team understands them. All of these Artifacts also have a defined
commitment, which describes their objectives.</p>
<h4>Product Backlog</h4>
<p>It is a list of what needs to be done in order to deliver or improve the product. It is created and overseen by the Scrum Team, where Product Owner
specifies the Product Goal and the Development Team refines it.</p>
<p>Product Backlog is constantly updating. That means its item are modified or new items are added, depending on situation. When adding
or modifying items, Product Backlog refinement should take place. It is the activity of breaking down tasks into smaller, more managable
and precise ones, and describing them accordingly in order to achieve transparency.</p>
<p>Product Backlog items can be assigned a cost. It is a arbitrary value, representing how much work should be done in order to deem it done.</p>
<p>At the beggining of each Sprint during Sprint planning, all tasks that are deemed to be doable in span of a single Sprint are removed,
and put in Sprint Backlog.</p>
<p>Product Backlog's commitment is Product Goal. It describes objective that should be achived after clearing Product Backlog.
Only one Product Goal should be worked upon at any given time. A necessary thing to remeber is that Product Goals are market-driven.
It means they should be set and changed according to market, that is usually to customers needs and requests.</p>
<h4>Sprint Backlog</h4>
<p>The Sprint Backlog is a list of all of Product Backlog's items, that could be done in span of a single Sprint. Sprint Backlog items
should be detailed enough, so that each Scrum Team member knows what what needs to be achived to finish it.</p>
<p>Similarly to Product Backlog, Sprint Backlog is constantly updated, as more is learned about the product. However, Sprint Backlog
items are mainly monitored and maintained by the Development Team.</p>
<p>Sprint progress can be measured using Spring Backlog items, as all should be completed in one Sprint. However, some tasks may take longer that
others. Here items cost comes in play. During Sprint Planning, total cost of all selected items shouldn't exceed a certain set threshold. This ensures
that all tasks can be achived during single Sprint. If the tasks cost is more then the threshold set, the Development Team should consider refining it.</p>
<p>Commitment of Sprint Backlog is the Sprint Goal. It is a single objective, attainable during the span of a single Sprint. Sprint Goal is created
during Sprint Planning, and helps to guide the Development Team towards the desired outcome. Although it shows what should
be done, it also provides flexibility. Sometimes, things can go wrong or take unexpected turns. When that happens, the Development Team discuss
with Product Owner scope of the Sprint Backlog without interfering with the Sprint Goal.</p>
<h4>Increment</h4>
<p>An Increment is the representation of some work done during single Sprint. Each Increment is added to all previous ones, and should provide value on its own as
well as work together with other Incremets. With empirical approach, this also means that the Increment should be usable, as to show what was achived.</p>
<p>All Incremets created during Sprint are presented at the Sprint Review. Incremets then can be delivered as a partial product to customers. They may be
delivered also beforehand, as Sprint Review only shows progress made towards Product Goal during single Sprint.</p>
<p>Increment cannot be considered an Increment, unless it meets the conditions stated in its commitment, Definition of Done.</p>

<p>Definition of Done, commonly abbrevieted as 'DoD', is a description, what items state is considered done. When Product Backlog item
meets its Definition of Done, it is considered then an Increment. When Sprint Backlog item's Definition of Done isn't met, it cannot
be delivered or even presented at Sprint Review.</p>

<p>Definition of Done should be clearly understandable to the whole Scrum Team, as it serves to ensure transparency. As a result, the Developers are required
to follow them. This ensures that the whole Development Team has a clear understanding of each item and knows how to make it an Increment.</p>
